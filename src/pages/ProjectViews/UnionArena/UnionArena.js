            text: "Engineered wood has emerged as a sustainable alternative to traditional construction materials: steel and concrete. It is made by bonding layers of timber together, resulting in stronger and more versatile beams and columns. QB Corporation, renowned for its production of glulam beams, was instrumental in the creation of ICCU Arena."

QB Corporation helped bring timber products from within the Moscow, Idaho region, capitalizing on abundant high-quality wood. In some cases, the Universityâ€™s Experimental Forest, a living laboratory for sustainable forestry practices, provided timber for the construction of the Arena."
